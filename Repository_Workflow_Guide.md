## Branching Strategy

While PRs are not required, itâ€™s still important to use branches to keep your work organized. Here's a recommended branching strategy:

1. **`main` (Stable Branch):**
   - Always contains stable, production-ready templates.
   - Changes are merged here only after testing.

2. **`develop` (Working Branch):**
   - Used for ongoing work and staging updates before merging to `main`.

3. **Feature Branches:**
   - Create a new branch for each new template or modification.
   - Naming conventions:
     - **New Template:** `feature/new-template-{name}`
     - **Modification:** `feature/update-template-{name}`
     - **Bug Fixes:** `fix/{description}`

## Adding a New Template

### Step 1: Create a New Branch
1. Switch to the `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
2. Create a new branch for the template:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-template-{name}
   ```

### Step 2: Add the Template
1. Create a new folder in the `templates` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir templates/{template_name}
   ```
2. Add the template files and a `README.md` with instructions for use.

### Step 3: Commit Changes
1. Stage your files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new template: {name}"
   ```

### Step 4: Merge to `develop`
1. Switch to the `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
2. Merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/new-template-{name}
   ```

## Modifying an Existing Template

### Step 1: Create a Branch
1. Switch to the `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
2. Create a new branch for the modification:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/update-template-{name}
   ```

### Step 2: Make Changes
- Edit the necessary files and update the `README.md` as needed.

### Step 3: Commit Changes
1. Stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Update template: {name} - {brief description}"
   ```

### Step 4: Merge to `develop`
1. Switch to the `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
2. Merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/update-template-{name}
   ```

## Syncing with Remote Repository

Once your changes are merged into `develop` or `main`, push them to the remote repository.

### Step 1: Push `develop` Changes
```bash
git push origin develop
```

### Step 2: Merge `develop` into `main`
1. Switch to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Merge `develop` into `main`:
   ```bash
   git merge develop
   ```
3. Push `main` to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Often:** Make small, meaningful commits to make tracking changes easier.
2. **Document Everything:** Ensure each template has a clear `README.md`.
3. **Backup Regularly:** Push changes to the remote repository frequently to avoid data loss.
